# C Programming Course Homework Repository 📚

Welcome to the C Programming Course Homework Repository! 🎉 This repository contains a collection of homework assignments from a university course in C programming. The course covers both C and C++ languages, and the assignments provided here are a mix of both. 🖥️💡

## Repository Structure 📂

The repository is organized as follows:

### Assignment Files 📝

- 📄 [soru1.c](soru1.c): Separating Odd and Even Numbers
  - This program reads integer values from the user and separates them into two linked lists: one for odd numbers and another for even numbers. 🔄🔢

- 📄 [soru2.cpp](soru2.c): Swapping First and Last Nodes
  - Swap the first and last nodes of a linked list. It creates a linked list with five nodes, assigns values from 1 to 5, performs the swap operation, and prints the modified linked list. 🔄🔀

- 📄 [soru3.cpp](soru3.c): Deleting Middle Node
  - Create a singly linked list based on user input. Then, delete the node located at the middle position of the list (if the position is valid) and display the updated list. ❌🔗

- 📄 [soru4.c](soru4.c): Appending Nodes and Swapping
  - Append nodes to the end of a linked list. It adds four nodes with values 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Then, swap the last node with the first node and display the modified linked list. 🔄🔗

- 📄 [soru5.cpp](soru5.c): Separating Even and Odd Numbers
  - This program reads integer values from the user and separates them into two linked lists: one for even numbers and another for odd numbers. 🔄🔢

### Getting Started 🚀

To get started with this repository, simply clone the repository and navigate to the desired assignment file. Each assignment file is self-contained and can be compiled and executed independently. Follow the instructions provided within each file's comments to understand the requirements and execute the program.

Feel free to explore and learn from the different assignments in this repository. They are designed to enhance your understanding of C programming concepts and improve your problem-solving skills. 👨‍💻📚
